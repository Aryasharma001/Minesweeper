<h1> About </h1>
Minesweeper is a logic puzzle video game generally played on personal computers. The game features a grid of clickable squares, with hidden "mines" scattered throughout the board. The objective is to clear the board without detonating any mines, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.
<h1> How to play ? </h1>
Begin by clicking on a random cell, and the later will reveal the number of mines surrounding the cell. Strategize your next movements by highlighting likely mine candidate cells to avoid. The player wins the game if the number of cells remaining is equal to the number of mines. If you ever click on the mine, the game will be declared finished at that point.

HAPPY PLAYING !
